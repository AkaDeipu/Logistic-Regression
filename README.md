This notebook uses logistic regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic, using the "Titanic_train.csv" dataset. It begins with data importing and EDA, including checking for null values and duplicates, and visualizing the survival count. The notebook then preprocesses the data by handling missing values and converting categorical features into a numerical format, preparing it for the logistic regression model.
